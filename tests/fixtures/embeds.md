We are incredibly excited by this future. That’s why we are building [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com), a platform to enable communities to collect and disburse money in full transparency. If you are also excited by this future, [create](https://opencollective.com/create) or [join](https://opencollective.com/discover) a collective and start experimenting with those ideas. We need more experiments. That’s how we learn best. And join us on [https://slack.opencollective.org](https://slack.opencollective.org).
